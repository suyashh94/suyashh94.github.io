  one_sentence_summary: This paper introduces ACE-RL, a reinforcement learning framework
    that enhances long-form text generation in LLMs by converting subjective quality
    evaluation into fine-grained, instruction-adaptive constraint verification.

  one_sentence_summary: This paper introduces Uniqueness-Aware Reinforcement Learning,
    which improves LLM reasoning diversity by reweighting policy advantages to favor
    correct but rare solution strategies, thereby addressing exploration collapse
    in RL-trained language models.

  one_sentence_summary: This paper identifies that GRPO's reward normalization collapses
    distinct multi-reward combinations into identical advantages, and proposes GDPO
    which decouples normalization per reward to preserve training signal granularity.
